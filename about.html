              <h3>Welcome to Ruma Candles!</h3>

              <p>
                In 2022 I bought a candle making kit simply to give something
                new a go and instantly fell in love with the process. I began
                researching into candle making with the aim to make some candles
                from scratch outside of using a set kit. I bought some
                equipment, wax and fragrance oils and through trial and error (a
                lot of trial and error!) I began to learn the craft of candle
                making. After receiving some positive feedback from family and
                friends I decided to create a small candle business to run in my
                spare time.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are some core values that were important to ensure that
                were integrated into the business from the start, I wanted to
                make the candles cruelty free, to be as environmentally friendly
                as possible and for the candles themselves to be handmade. With
                this in mind I chose a vegan soy wax for the candles, glass
                containers and cardboard packaging so that everything is fully
                recyclable. All of the candles are made by hand, by me in my
                kitchen at home.
              </p>

                My background working in advertising has meant that I have been
                able to shoot and edit all of the product photography myself, as
                well as create the website.

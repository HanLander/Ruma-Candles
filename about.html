              Hello! Welcome to Ruma Candles. In 2022 I bought a candle making
              kit simply for something new to try one weekend and instantly fell
              in love with the process. I found it therapeutic, fun and enjoyed
              the specificity that making candles requires. I researched more
              into candle making with the aim to make some candles from scratch,
              outside of using a pre-made kit with the wax to scent ratios set
              out on a piece of paper. I bought some different waxes to
              experiment with, a variety of fragrance oils, containers and wicks
              and through trial and error (a lot of trial and error!) I began to
              learn the craft of handmade candles. I gave away some of my
              candles to family and friends I had lots of positive feedback. It
              was then that I decided to create a small candle business to run
              in my spare time.

              There are some core values that were important to ensure that were
              integrated into the business from the start, I wanted to make the
              candles cruelty free, to be as environmentally friendly as
              possible and for the candles themselves to be handmade. With this
              in mind I chose a vegan soy wax for the candles, glass containers
              and cardboard packaging so that everything is fully recyclable.
              All of the candles are made by hand in my kitchen at home.

              My background working in advertising has meant that I have been
              able to shoot and edit all of the product photography myself, as
              well as create the website. Ruma Candles was launched in 2023
              selling on Etsy and at local markets. Thank you for shopping
              small.
